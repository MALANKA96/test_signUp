## Test tasks for creating a sign up form.
Sign up form should have 4 input fields with validation 
(login, email, password, confirm password) 
and one submit button, when clicked, which outputs data from the form to the console.

### The solution used the following tasks:
- react.js
- redux-form
- material-ui

### Running this example locally
- git clone https://github.com/MALANKA96/test_signUp.git
- cd ./test_signUp
- npm install
- npm start
